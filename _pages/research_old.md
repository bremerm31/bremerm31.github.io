I am a computational molecular and integrative biologist and mathematical scientist. Currently, my
research is in three areas:
- Massively parallel characterization of CRISPR specificity.
- State of the art indel-correcting DNA barcodes.
- Bat transcriptomics, phylogenetic history, and positive selection.


## CRISPR Specificity: CHAMP

The past few years have seen a revolution in gene-editing technology thanks to the discovery and
development of the CRISPR family of proteins for gene-editing. But wild type CRISPR proteins are
known to occasionally cut DNA in unintended locaitons, which could potentially cause new diseases
in patients. Before CRISPR can gain wide use in human medicine, we need better understanding and
control of its DNA targeting to ensure it does exactly and only what we want it to. 

I worked with a team from the Finkelstein lab to develop the Chip-Hybridized Association Mapping
Platform (CHAMP), a massively parallel platform for characterizing protein-DNA binding
interactions. It works by recovering Illumina sequencing chips after sequencing, performing further
biochemical assays on the sequenced chip, and observing reactions with a total internal reflection
fluorescence (TIRF) microscope. I used Fourier methods, linear least squares, machine learning, and
non-linear optimization to turn large-scale raw data into per-sequence binding specificity
information.

We used this platform to interrogate the target specificity of the most common CRISPR system in
nature, the CRISPR Cascade complex. I visualized the binding specificity of several classes of
sequences and developed mathematical and statistical models to characterize the Cascade complex
specificity profile. We fully characterized an extended 6 bp protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) and
showed that while the canonical 3 bp are the most important, positions 4, 5, and 6 can have a
significant effect on intermediate PAMs. We also found a novel periodic reduction of specificity
every 3 + 6*n* bases in the target sequence.  We were then able to use our method to look at the
binding specificity for a CRISPR protein across an entire human exome for the first time.  This
technique can be used in a clinical setting to verify *in vitro* the safety of a proposed
gene-therapy treatment on a per-patient basis. 


## State of the Art Barcoding: FREE Barcodes

DNA barcodes, short DNA sequences used to label individual biomolecules in pooled populations, are
ubiquitous throughout modern biology. This simple technology has enabled the development of
exciting new assays such as single-cell RNA sequencing and massively parallel drug screening.
However, DNA barcodes are subject to standard DNA errors: substitutions, insertions, and deletions.
Previous methods have used Hamming or Levenshtein distance to try to correct some of these errors,
but neither of these metrics correctly accounts for insertions and deletions in DNA barcodes due to
uncertainty in the location of the right end of the barcode.

I developed and experimentally validated Filled/truncated Right End Edit (FREE) barcodes to
correctly account for the kinds of errors observed in real DNA barcodes. This required the
development of new high-dimensional algorithms, finite field linear algebra, dynamic programming,
and the proof of various properties of FREE divergence space. Because FREE barcodes correctly
account for the kinds of errors seen in DNA barcodes, they are able to correct errors with higher
accuracy than previous methods, using fewer bp for the same number of barcodes. I generated a
single-error correcting barcode library with &gt;10<sup>6</sup> unique barcodes. And due to their
construction, FREE barcodes can be easily concatenated. This allows for combinatorially large
barcode libraries and/or arbitrarily low error rates with different strategies. I demonstrated
these possibilities with an example library with &gt;10<sup>15</sup> barcodes and an example
library with error rates of &lt;10<sup>-19</sup>. 


## Bat Phylogenetics and Positive Selection

The order Chiroptera, the order of bats, is one of the most interesting and diverse orders of
mammals. Not only are they interesting due to their ability to fly and echolocate, but they are of
interest to human health because they are the known or suspected reservoirs of several deadly human
viruses, including SARS, Nipah, Hendra, and Ebola. Improving our understanding of bat cellular
pathways can give us insight into how these viruses function in their natural hosts, leading the
way for more effectively combatting these diseases.

I performed an order Chiroptera meta-analysis of publically available DNA sequencing data and novel
data we sequenced ourselves to perform phylogenetic and positive selection analyses. Positive
selection, indicated by a dN/dS statistic value &gt;1, is a signature of genes which have a history
of viral antagonism.  We identified 299 such genes, which will be of interest for further
investigation by the virology community. My collaborators have, in fact, already used the sequences
of one gene family, NPC1, to identify one of the key amino acids in the bat NPC1 protein which
acts as a barrier to cell entry and infection from the Ebola virus.
