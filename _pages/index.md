# About

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences](https://www.oden.utexas.edu/) in the The University of Texas at Austin, where I am supervised by [Clint Dawson](http://chg.ices.utexas.edu/). I am a Department of Energy [Computational Science Graduate Fellow](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/) as well as a [Donald D. Harrington Fellow](https://harrington.utexas.edu/).

I previously completed [Part III](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/part-iii/current) at University of Cambridge with an emphasis on Partial Differential equations. Before that, I earned a B.Sc. in Aerospace Engineering and a B.Sc. in Applied Mathematics from the University of Texas at Austin.

My work lies at the intersection of computer science and numerical analysis. The advent of exascale computing represents a paradigm shift for scientific computing. Power-constrained design choices and the end of Dennard scaling have led to exponential growth in on-node concurrency.
The difficulty of productively programming in light of this deluge of concurrency has led to the emergence of numerous task-based programming models (e.g. HPX, Legion, charm++, etc.). I am looking at the expressivity of these new programming models to accelerate the simulation of hurricane storm surge. Not only am I looking to leverage features provided by these models, but I am looking to go a step further. I am interested in the design of novel irregular--but crucially scalable--algorithms inspired by the flexibility of tasking frameworks. In particular, I am looking at dynamic load balancing and adaptive local timestepping methods. Learn more details about my research [here](/research/).


Outside of work, I enjoy cooking (eating) and weightlifting (dealing with the ramification of eating).
I enjoy living Austin, taking advantage of the restaurant and music scences. I am also an avid reader
two of the most recent books I've read can be found [here](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25082429-garments-against-women) and [here](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/355320.The_Inner_Chapters).
