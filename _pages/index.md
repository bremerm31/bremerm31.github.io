# About

I am currently a post-doctoral scholar in the [Computer Architecture Group](https://crd.lbl.gov/departments/computer-science/cag/) looking at co-design of post-Moore architectures.

I obtained my Ph.D. from the [Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences](https://www.oden.utexas.edu/) at the The University of Texas at Austin under the supervision of [Clint Dawson](http://chg.ices.utexas.edu/). I was a Department of Energy [Computational Science Graduate Fellow](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/) as well as a [Donald D. Harrington Fellow](https://harrington.utexas.edu/).
I previously completed [Part III](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/part-iii/current) at University of Cambridge with an emphasis on Partial Differential equations. Before that, I earned a B.Sc. in Aerospace Engineering and a B.Sc. in Applied Mathematics from the University of Texas at Austin.

My work lies at the intersection of computer science and numerical analysis. The advent of exascale computing represents a paradigm shift for scientific computing. Power-constrained design choices and the end of Dennard scaling have led to exponential growth in on-node concurrency.
The difficulty of productively programming in light of this deluge of concurrency has led to the emergence of numerous task-based programming models (e.g. HPX, Legion, charm++, etc.). I am looking at the expressivity of these new programming models to accelerate the simulation of hurricane storm surge. Not only am I looking to leverage features provided by these models, but I am looking to go a step further. I am interested in the design of novel irregular--but crucially scalable--algorithms inspired by the flexibility of tasking frameworks. In particular, I am looking at dynamic load balancing and adaptive local timestepping methods. Learn more details about my research [here](/research/).


Outside of work, I enjoy cooking and weightlifting.
I currently live in the Bay area where I am taking advantage of the wonderful outdoors and farmers markets.
Two of the most recent books I've read can be found [here](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20518872-the-three-body-problem) and [here](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85767.Gender_Trouble).
